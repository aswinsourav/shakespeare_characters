# Vector representation of character's in Shakespeare plays.

## Description: 
Using PVDM and PVDBOW proposed by Mikolov et al, the project aims to represent the characters of Shakespeare plays as vectors based on the words they speak and thereby cluster related characters together.

## Usage: 
1) Pick any play  or set of plays of Shakesphere.
2) Mention them in the PLAY_LIST at role2vec.py
3) Execute and wait for the model to train.......
4) Get an image file for each play, which visualizes the characters based on its vector representation.

Please refer to wiki for implementation details and code walkthrough.

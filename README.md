# shakespeare_characters
Vector representation of character's in Shakespeare plays.

Description: Using PVDM and PVDBOW proposed by Mikolov et al, the project aims to represent the characters of Shakespeare plays as vectors based on the words they speak and thereby cluster related characters together.

Usage: 
1) Pick any play  or set of plays of Shakesphere
2) Pass it to the list in role2vec.py
3) Wait for the model to train.......
4) Get an image file for each play, which visualizes each character based on its vector representation.

Please refer to wiki for implementation details and code walkthrough.
